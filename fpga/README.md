# `fpga/` — XCKU3P fit (Vivado) for the GLM-5.2 **Q4_K** accelerator

The **[PENDING] hardware-fit gate**: turn the verified Q4_K RTL into a **real, routed
FPGA fit** — actual LUT / DSP / BRAM utilization and routed **Fmax** on a Kintex
UltraScale+ **XCKU3P** — the number iverilog (sim) and yosys (`check-assert`,
structural) cannot give. Getting this number sets the FPGA class → the box's size,
thermal budget, BOM, and per-seat price.

> **Track note.** This is the **current Q4_K / XCKU3P / Vivado** flow. A prior scaffold
> targeted **FP8 on Gowin GW5AT-138** (`gowin/`, `nextpnr/`); that referenced the FP8
> datapath now removed from `main` (preserved on branch `fp8`) and is superseded here.

## What it synthesizes
`glm_q4k_system_cdc` — the whole 2-clock product top (compute die `glm_model_q4k` +
memory system + CDC) — in the **compact** config (result-invariant resource params:
`PE_N 4→2, DDR_NCH 4→2, KV_RESIDENT 16→8, EFIFO_DEPTH 16→8, CACHE_SLOTS 4→2`). The
decoded token is byte-identical to the default config (proven in sim); only the
parallelism/capacity shrinks to target a small dev-board part.

## Files
| File | What |
|---|---|
| `synth_ku3p.tcl` | Vivado batch: read the 24 Q4_K sources → **(1)** `synth_design` of the raw product top `glm_q4k_system_cdc` → `util_synth.rpt` (pure resource fit, no pins); **(2)** `synth_design` + place + route of `bringup_harness` → `util_routed.rpt` + `timing.rpt` (routed Fmax) |
| `bringup_harness.v` | SYNTHESIZABLE P&R harness: wraps the exact product top but buries its thousands of wide memory-side ports (DDR/flash/KV/dequant buses + `logits`) behind an on-chip LFSR/CRC, so I/O collapses to 5 clock/control pins + 1 output → **routable**. Non-constant LFSR drivers keep the datapath from being pruned, so the routed fit is real. Verified: iverilog elaborates + yosys `hierarchy -check`/`check -assert` clean (no comb loop from the registered feedback) |
| `constraints.xdc` | `create_clock` for `host_clk` + `core_clk` + async CDC groups (timing/CDC only — **pin locations are board-specific**, add from your board's master XDC). Same clock/reset port names on both the system and the harness, so it applies to either top |
| `run_fit.sh` | runs the tcl in the Vivado Docker container (pins the container MAC for the license hostid, mounts `Xilinx.lic`, installs the tool's runtime libs, sources `settings64.sh`) |
| `out/` | reports land here (`util_synth.rpt`, `util_routed.rpt`, `timing.rpt`, checkpoints) |

## Run
Vivado ML must be installed into the `xilinx_install` docker volume first. Then from
the repo root:
```bash
bash fpga/run_fit.sh
```

### License (one-time, free)
Vivado ML **2026.1 refuses to launch without a valid license** — not even a trivial
batch script (verified: a bare `puts` script errors `valid license was not found`).
The **free "Vivado ML Standard"** edition covers XCKU3P (KU3P/KU5P are the free-tier
UltraScale+ parts), but you must generate a $0 license once:
1. <https://www.xilinx.com/getlicense> → sign in → **Vivado ML Standard** (Node-Locked, free).
2. Host ID: `run_fit.sh` pins the container MAC to `02:42:c0:a8:64:02`, so give the
   FlexLM host id **`0242c0a86402`** when the portal asks.
3. Save the generated `Xilinx.lic` to `/Users/Shared/xilinx/Xilinx.lic` (or export
   `XILINX_LICENSE=/path/to/Xilinx.lic`), then re-run `bash fpga/run_fit.sh`.

`run_fit.sh` auto-mounts the `.lic` and sets `XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE`; the fixed MAC
keeps the node-locked license valid across container runs.

> The portal now names the free tier **"Vivado Basic Tier License, Node Locked"**
> (the ML-Standard/WebPACK successor); it grants `Vivado_Synthesis` +
> `Vivado_Implementation` + `Vivado_Simulation`, which covers this whole flow.

### Docker crash workaround (handled automatically by `run_fit.sh`)
With a valid license, Vivado 2026.1 in Docker then **aborts at launch** with
`realloc(): invalid pointer` — the FlexLM checkout (`libXil_lmgr11.so`) scans
network devices through `libudev`, and Vivado's bundled `libtcmalloc.so.4`
(loaded as `NEEDED` by the main binary, pure malloc interposition — zero direct
`tc_*` references) mixes allocators with glibc-internal allocations inside that
scan. Verified on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 images; `LD_PRELOAD`/`/etc/ld.so.preload`
shims do **not** help because lmgr `dlopen`s libudev directly. The fix that works:
bind-mount an **empty stub** `.so` over the bundled `libtcmalloc.so.4` (removes the
interposition; everything runs on plain glibc). `run_fit.sh` builds and mounts the
stub automatically. Feature libs additionally need `libpixman-1-0 libcairo2
libpango-1.0-0 libglib2.0-0 libfreetype6 libfontconfig1` (also installed by the
script).

## Adjust for your board
- **Part**: edit `PART` in `synth_ku3p.tcl` (package/speed grade, e.g. `xcku3p-ffvb676-2-e`).
- **Fmax sweep**: tighten `core_clk` period in `constraints.xdc`; achieved Fmax = `1/(period − WNS)` (WNS from `out/timing.rpt`).
- **Pins**: add `set_property PACKAGE_PIN`/`IOSTANDARD` from your dev board's master XDC.

## Honest notes
- **First real fit** — expect Vivado to surface synthesis-specific issues the structural
  yosys gate did not (width/timing/inference warnings); iterate.
- **Wide top-level ports** (resolved): `glm_q4k_system_cdc` exposes thousands of
  memory-/logits-side bits (`logits`=VOCAB·16, `h_state`, DDR/Flash/KV/dequant buses).
  Full P&R would fail on **I/O count** on a real package. `bringup_harness.v` buries all
  of them behind an on-chip LFSR/CRC (expose only host pins), so the tcl's step (2) routes
  the harness for the real Fmax; step (1) still reports pure-product resources synth-only.
- **RAM**: compact-system P&R is memory-heavy; if `route_design` OOMs on the Docker
  allocation, raise Docker Desktop memory or run synth-only first.
